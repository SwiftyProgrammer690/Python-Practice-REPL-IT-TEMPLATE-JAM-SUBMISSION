# Hello üëã

This repl is used for practicing your python üêç skills! Hope you enjoy! If you are a beginner, that is perfectly fine! You will be able to start using this right away!

## Getting Started üöÄ
You might have already noticed that there is not anything in the `main.py` file... That is becuase you will not be writing your code in there but rather, you will be executing your code in there! 

There are two ways you can execute your code! NOTE: If you are using method no. 2, then please make sure to write your code in a function!

  1. Use the bash terminal/shell: After you have written some code in a file, go to the shell and type in `python example.py`, if that does not work, try, `python3 (or python4) example.py`.
  2. Go to the `main.py` file and type, `from example.py import *` and on the next line, write, `yourfunction(parameters)`. Then click run!

You should stick to using one method for this!
And make sure to go in order indicated by the number next to the file names!
